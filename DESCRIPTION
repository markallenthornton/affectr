Description: This package computes the affect of text using weighted dictionaries. Although intended for sentiment analysis, other word vectors can also be scored. The included 3-D affect space - consisting of rationality, social impact, and valence - was derived from analysis of patterns of brain activity associated thinking about individual mental states: Tamir, D. I., Thornton, M. A., Contreras, J. M., & Mitchell, J. P. (2016). Neural evidence that three dimensions organize mental state representation: Rationality, social impact, and valence. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 113(1), 194-199.
